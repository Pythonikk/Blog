# Blog App

An assignment through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-blog-app) which has us follow along with [The ruby on Rails Guides: Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), sections 1-11. We were advised to skip section 9.2 (on concerns) as it has been causing issues.

The goal here was to get a feel for the process of creating a simple Rails application-- to see how the components of MVC talk to each other, and experiment with some of these new methods.

My implementation follows the recommendations of the tutorial with the addition of a header on each page linking back to the root page, rework of the way comments on an article appear, and some basic html formatting like <br> tags.

I did want to add some simple css and got the index page looking nice putting css in assets/stylesheets/application.css, but while trying to use other stylesheets for the other pages I learned that there is some stuff to know about the asset pipeline before throwing stuff in that directory. There is an Odin lesson on that very topic coming up soon so ill add to this project as i can.
